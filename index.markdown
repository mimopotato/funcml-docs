Welcome to the Funcml documentation!

Funcml is a **data-structure framework** developed in _Ruby_. This project consists of an implementation of functions based on overrides of Ruby's primitive classes (Hash, Array, String, Integer, etc.) called "_funcml-core_" and a command-line tool, "_funcml-cli_", which uses _funcml-core_.

The creation of the funcml concept is linked to the limitations encountered when using YAML as a descriptive language for element serialization. funcml takes advantage of the global knowledge of YAML and JSON users by providing just the right amount of additional functions, perfectly integrated into the language.

## Start now !

Read the user guide to speed up the writing of your configuration or status description files! Funcml is fun and has been designed to be easy to learn.

Funcml includes:
* generation loops
* variable support
* merging of several structure files (yaml, json or both)
* mathematical functions
* conditional block generation
* a type conversion system
* and many other functions...
